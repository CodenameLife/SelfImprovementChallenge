# Self-Improvement Challenge

WARNING! Chellange not yet started. It should be ready in beginning of August.

Someday is not a time and doing something is not an action. Goal is simple: 160 days of application of new self-improvement mechanisms. Things designed to live longer, happier and healthier, concentrate deeper, express yourself better and become programming master. This all needs:
 * Change in habits,
 * Support from different tools,
 * A lot of knowladge to adopt,
 * A lot of skill practice,
 * Mindset to be changed.
 
Goals are simple, and the way is important. Time is passing and we are dying a little bit everyday by aging. What have you done yesterday to make your life and yourself better? How much did you promised yourself that you will start changing your life for better? To break this impasse, you need to start working on it NOW! Not tommorow, not someday. You need to start today.

 # Rules

Rules of chellange are simple: 
 * Start from repository Fork and then edit it whenever you finish next task. 
 * There is a chellange for everyday that needs to be done. Do it as early as possible. Treat this chellange with high priority.
 * Do not outstrip. You can do more then planned, but only stuff that won't encumber you in next days. For example, when you learn using Anki do not add more cards then planned because this will require additional work in next days.
 * When you make one step, mark it as done and commit this change to your repository together with information what you did. Remamber, that everyone can see when you finished each step. I we (CodenemeLife) will check it out from time to time :)
 * Whenever you feel that some step can be improved, start issue or suggest change.
